### 2025 Trainings Presented by GTK Cyber

GTK Cyber [www.gtkcyber.com](https://www.gtkcyber.com) was founded to bridge the gap between Data Science and Cyber Security and not only provide high standard hands-on trainings, but introduce students to the most cutting-edge technologies and advancements in artificial intelligence, all with a focus on direct applicability to cyber security.

### Setting Up Your Environment
To run the exercises in the course, you will need an environment which can view Jupyter Notebooks and Python version 3.11.

1.  Navigate to the directory where you have downloaded the course materials.
2. Run the script `setup_env` which will install the required packages and activate a virtual environment.


We recommend either:
* Anaconda (https://anaconda.com)
* PyCharm (https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/)
* Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com) with Jupyter plugins.

Alternatively, you can use our JupyterLab environment at https://labs.gtkcyber.com. 

## AI Usage
For this course, you will need an OpenAI API key.  You can get one by creating an account at https://openai.com.  You may have to set up billing for this service.
